### Hello.

#### Here is what I'm currently contributing to open source:

- https://github.com/ppy/osu: sitting at >150 PRs, fixing a ton of bugs (especially on UI), and doing project management.
- https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox: reporting issues until they release their source code.

#### What I used to contribute to:

- https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki: brought consistency in their Markdown format and did a lot of reviews (>400 is what GitHub says), taking a >1 year break because of https://github.com/ppy/osu and inability to contribute efficiently and effectively, might go back once I feel the same with what I'm contributing right now.
- https://github.com/ppy/osu-web: made >100 issues and 80% were resolved. Pretty solid website right now if you ask me.

#### The future...

I plan on contributing to other open source projects when I'm experienced enough at coding in general.
