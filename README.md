### Hello.

#### I'm currently working on:

- [ppy/osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu): Top 10 contributor[^1] fixing a ton of bugs (UI mostly) and helping with project management.
- [uhe-org/uhe](https://github.com/uhe-org/uhe): Made myself to learn the Rainmeter suite workflow and probably due for a redesign / new suite since it's not innovative enough.
- [OriginalCube/Bocchi-Wallpaper](https://github.com/OriginalCube/Bocchi-Wallpaper): A popular Wallpaper Engine wallpaper. Favorite music anime right on the desktop. Implementing features and fixing bugs occasionally.
  - [Joehuu/Toaru-Wallpaper](https://github.com/Joehuu/Toaru-Wallpaper): Just my "fork" for a certain anime, has some exclusive features/additions not in upstream.
- [Project OutFox](https://projectoutfox.com/): Yet another fork of StepMania but closed-source right now. Occasionally reporting issues and providing theme patches (if they ever apply them), currently in their [Discord sever](https://discord.gg/cN4TjgQdcA).
